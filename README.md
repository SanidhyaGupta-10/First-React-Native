# Welcome to My First React Native App 🎉

This is my first React Native learning project created with Expo. A hands-on exploration of cross-platform mobile development using React Native's core components, navigation, and state management.

## What I'm Building 🏗️

A mobile app that demonstrates fundamental React Native concepts:
- 📱 **Cross-platform** UI components (iOS & Android)

- 🎨 **Responsive layouts** using Flexbox
